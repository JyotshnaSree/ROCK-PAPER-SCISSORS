Rock, Paper, Scissors - Game Description
This is a Python-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game that allows a player to compete against the computer in multiple rounds. The game follows the classic rules where:

Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors)
Scissors beat Paper (Scissors cut Paper)
Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock)
The player is prompted to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors), while the computer randomly selects one. The game then determines the winner based on the predefined rules. If both the player and the computer choose the same move, the round is declared a tie.

Additionally, this version improves upon the basic game by:
✅ Supporting multiple rounds
✅ Keeping track of scores for both the player and the computer
✅ Allowing the player to exit the game at any time by entering 'quit'
✅ Validating user input to ensure only correct choices are made

At the end of the game, the final scores are displayed, showing the total wins for both the player and the computer. This enhanced Rock, Paper, Scissors game adds an engaging and interactive experience while keeping the classic gameplay intact.
